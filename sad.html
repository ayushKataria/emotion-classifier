   <div> <p> Hey! <br> <br> 
    It looks like you are in a SAD mood today!<br> <br> </div></div>
       <div>You could release pent-up feelings of sadness and grief through a raga. </div> 
            <div>Rasa or emotions are associated with ragas, and for Karuna Rasa, your emotional catharsis can be found through a raga like Lalit. Its juxtaposition of shuddh, or natural and komal, or sharp notes create dissonance, mirroring the depth of your emotions; its slow to medium tempo (vilambit to madhya laya) will give you time to reflect; and its madhya, or medium octave range will evoke a sense of gravity and create room for introspection. Lastly, the ornamentation of meends, or glides, and andolan, or slow oscillations will bring about a meditative quality, ultimately working towards lifting your mood.</div> 
            <div> Here are a few minutes of the Bandish or composition of Raga Lalit. </div>
        </p>

   <div> <p> Hey! <br> <br> 
    It looks like you have been SURPRISED today!<br> <br> </div></div>
       <div>You could use the jolt of surprise to gain perspective and feel increased wonder! </div> 
            <div> 
                Rasa or emotions are associated with ragas, and for Adhubuta Rasa, a raga like Bahar can draw you into deeper appreciation and enchantment. Its myriad notes – shuddha, tivra, and komal - or natural, sharp and flat will present you an electric experience of clarity, intermingled with intensity, seriousness and serenity. Its fluctuating medium (madhya laya) and fast (drut laya) tempo will make you feel lively and expressive; its madhya samptak, or medium range will form a solid grounding to create excitement; and its spirited ornaments, or zig-zag vakras will immerse you in a playful, whimsical moment. It could be the wonder of a sunset, the freshness of spring, or even a lively Friday evening with friends!</div> 
            <div> Here are a few minutes of the Bandish or composition of Raga Bahar. </div>
